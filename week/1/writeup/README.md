Overall, you should have the interest of the public and the public’s safety in mind and do what is best by them, not is best by your company (if it goes against the interest of the public) or yourself. This may be difficult, but it is your civic and moral duty to intervene when you know something is wrong. When you first realize the issue, you should immediately tell your boss about the situation and seek his guidance on what to do. If your boss refuses to recognize and facilitate fixing the issue, you should continue to move up the ladder of your company until proper measures are taken. If the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU release, then one may need to leek online the fact that your company is about to release firmware that has security issues in order to put some pressure on the company to not release. Do not give out too many details about the security issue because you do not want others to exploit the issue. If you take this route, be very careful and do not do anything too reckless, for people’s lives are at stake. Furthermore, do not attempt to stop the company on your own. You are most likely to succeed with the help of others. If you do nothing, you are responsible for any harm that results because you had the power to attempt to prevent it. As theodore roosevelt so gracefully put it, “In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing. The worst thing you can do is nothing”.
